or How to make relative frequency table. 



```{r}
tbl <- tibble(freq1 = c(1:3), freq2 = c(4:6))

tbl_rel %>% 
  transmute(across(everything(), ~ ./sum(.)))

# reprex
dput(tbl)
dput(tbl_rel)

tbl <- tibble(name = letters[1:3], freq1 = c(1:3), freq2 = c(4:6))

```


 How can you apply a transformation (here, "transmute") to a subset of columns, but continue to work with the whole dataframe. That is, select, transform, and _unselect_. Instead, I use `bind_cols()`.
```{r}
tbl <- tibble(name = letters[1:3], freq1 = c(1:3), freq2 = c(4:6))

bind_cols(tbl["name"], tbl %>% 
            transmute(across(matches("\\d"), ~ ./ sum(.))))

# divide by value of particular row per column, rather than sum of column
bind_cols(tbl["name"], tbl %>% 
            transmute(across(matches("\\d"), ~ ./ .[3])))
```
